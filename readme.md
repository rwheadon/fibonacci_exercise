This exercise is written in Ruby.

There is a class Fibonacci that will return a specified size set of the Fibonacci sequence.

The simple login page uses sessions, a single configured acceptable password and routes to erb pages. This way I didn't have to set up a database and do registrations.

This example could be expanded to allow user to specify the number of sequence members to return.


The following ruby gems were loaded to run this example on my localhost:

$ gem install sinatra  
$ gem install shotgun  
$ gem install rspec (for a few Fibonacci class tests)  

The username doesn't matter, password is 'fibworld'
